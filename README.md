# Machine Learning for Chemical Engineering (ML4CE)

Welcome to the Machine Learning for Chemical Engineering (ML4CE) course repository. This module introduces machine learning concepts for chemical engineering applications through coding projects.

 **ML4CE** is a module offered at Imperial College London for 4th Year MEng and MSc students in the Chemical Engineering Department. The course introduces students to core machine learning concepts and their applications in solving chemical engineering problems. The course is assessed via mini-projects that allow students to apply machine learning and optimisation techniques to chemical engineering case studies.

This repository contains the material for the coursework coding projects.
